Welcome to my blog! 

I am a data scientist, machine learning engineer, algorithm developer in neuraltech and healthtech areas. 
I have also been an academic researcher for over 10 years. 
I have extensive experiences in electrophysiological signal processing, brain-computer interfacing and cognitive and clinical research. 
My goal is to leverage my skills to make the world a healthier place. 

This blog is my memorandum of what I have learned through my research activities. 
Good results are published as academic papers, while negative results are usually discarded and forgotten.
However, such results are sometimes useful because they prevent others from wasting their time by making the same mistake.
I hope my blog posts help you out.
