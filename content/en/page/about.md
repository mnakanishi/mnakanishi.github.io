Welcome to my blog! 

I am a data & research scientist, algorithm developer, and biomedical & neural engineer. 
I have 10+ years of experiences in developing brain-computer interfaces and its real-world & clinical applications. 
My goal is to leverage my skills including research design and data analysis to make the world healthier! 

This blog is my memorandum of what I have learned through my research activities. 
Good results are published as academic papers, while negative results are usually discarded and forgotten.
However, such results are sometimes useful because they prevent others from wasting their time by making the same mistake.
Also, the difficulty encountered in carrying out projects could be worth sharing. 

I hope my blog posts help you out.
