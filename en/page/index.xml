      <description>Welcome to my blog!
I am a data &amp;amp; research scientist, algorithm developer, and biomedical &amp;amp; neural engineer. I have 10+ years of experiences in developing brain-computer interfaces and its real-world &amp;amp; clinical applications. My goal is to leverage my skills including research design and data analysis to make the world healthier!
This blog is my memorandum of what I have learned through my research activities. Good results are published as academic papers, while negative results are usually discarded and forgotten.</description>
